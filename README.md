# Schedule-1-Recipe-List-GUI

this mod lets you easily find the recipes for products you have discovered or favorited

How To Use:

Step 1.  load a save then open the pause menu with esc or open your phone so you get a mouse cursor

Step 2. press F5 to open them menu

Step 3. press the + next the menus to expand them ( by default the menus are minimized helps with performance )

Step 4. select drug type then find your product or select a product from the favorites menu

Step 5. sometimes the product you have selected has more then 1 recipe so you will be asked to select what recipe you want

F6 while the menu is open to reset the menus back to the starting location (guis can go off screen)

on the recipe page at the bottom left there is a box you can use to resize the page

this is my first time really doing anything in C# im also just bad at coding so the performance of this is probably not great if anyone wants to help improve the mod feel free to make a pull request or contact me on discord rezx1
